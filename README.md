# PHP Arrays

Arrays in PHP is a type of data structure that allows 
us to store multiple elements of similar data type under a single variable thereby saving us the effort of creating a different variable for every data. The arrays are helpful to create a list of elements of similar types, which can be accessed using their index or key. Suppose we want to store five names and print them accordingly. This can be easily done by the use of five different string variables. But if instead of five, the number rises to hundred, then it would be really difficult for the user or developer to create so much different variables. Here array comes into play and helps us to store every element within a single variable and also allows easy access using an index or a key. An array is created using an array() function in PHP.

## There are basically three types of arrays in PHP:

- Indexed or Numeric Arrays: An array with a numeric index where values are stored linearly.
- Associative Arrays: An array with a string index where instead of linear storage, each value can be assigned a specific key.
- Multidimensional Arrays: An array which contains single or multiple array within it and can be accessed via multiple indices.

##  Indexed or Numeric Arrays

These type of arrays can be used to store any type of elements, but an index is always a number. By default, the index starts at zero. These arrays can be created in two different ways as shown in the following example:

## Associative Arrays

These type of arrays are similar to the indexed arrays but instead of linear storage, every value can be assigned with a user-defined key of string type.

## Multidimensional Arrays

Multi-dimensional arrays are such arrays which stores an another array at each index instead of single element. In other words, we can define multi-dimensional arrays as array of arrays. As the name suggests, every element in this array can be an array and they can also hold other sub-arrays within. Arrays or sub-arrays in multidimensional arrays can be accessed using multiple dimensions.
